Flow: 
    Ollama llm -> 
    
    Model using Zero-Shot-classification to classify diff as... 

        - Contains a fully implemented feature
        - Does not

    -----------------------------------------------------------

        - Contains a fully implemented bug fix
        - Does not

    -----------------------------------------------------------

        - Contains a fully implemented refactor
        - Does not
    ->

    User is notified of a possible full implemented ->

    User approves or rejects the existance of each of the classifications ->

    Model loops through each hunk from git add -p and using Zero-Shot-classification it classifies the hunk as... 

        - Part of the commit
        - Not part of the commit    


Model Options:
1. LLM
    Pros:
    - No training needed
    - Likely better classification abilities
    
    Cons:
    - Limited fine-tuning potential

    Notes: 
    - We might not be able to fine tune the model itself, but we could fine tune the confidence tresholds for 
    each of the categories (fully implemented feature, bug fix, or refactor) when determining whether or not
    one of the categories exist in the diff

2. PL-NL Model (Like CodeBERT):
    Pros:
    - Finetune each model specific to the user (based on if they accept or reject the ai output)
    
    Cons:
    - Needs to be trained (thus we would need a lot of training data)
    - Probably not great at classifications
